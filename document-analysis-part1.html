        </header>

        <section class="warning">
            <h2>Warning</h2>
            <p><strong>Sample Size = 1</strong>.<br/><small>All results listed in this analysis are based on a single output from each model. I encourage running similar tests with more samples if you have the time and compute!</small></p>
        </section>

        <section class="summary">
            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>This analysis tested 20 local Large Language Models (LLMs) on their ability to extract information from unstructured research notes and provide an accurate summary and short analysis. Each model received identical general task description and the same notes attachment. Their responses were checked for errors, and all errors were noted and categorized.</p>
            <p>All models except one (Mistral Large) made factual errors, demonstrating the general unreliability of LLMs in providing accurate information.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="summary">
            <h2>Conditions</h2>
            <p>Unless otherwise noted, all models were run locally using <a href="https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a> CPU-only inference, using the default template included in the GGUF, with default llama.cpp settings and a context window of 16384 tokens. No custom system prompt was given. All models received the exact same task and attachment file. The prompt and file information is listed below.</p>

            <blockquote>
                I did some research on using local LLM models for coding and I have the notes attached. Please create a HTML page containing the results. I want a table with models and results (one model per row, with columns like model properties, first prompt result, second prompt result, performance, etc). In addition to the table I want a summary and/or analysis of the results. Try to make the whole thing a bit shorter than the source text.
            </blockquote>

            <pre><code>$ wc ai-local-llm-coding.txt
  219  5107 30638 ai-local-llm-coding.txt</code></pre>

            <p>The attached file was plain text (no formatting or markup), had 219 lines and 5107 words, totaling approximately 30 KB. The models generally tokenized this into 7500~8500 tokens. It contained incomplete, unstructured research notes and comments, including a small number of conflicting statements.</p>
            <p>The prompt is intentionally general; no effort was spent on trying to specify exactly what the model should do, in order to simulate the default experience of someone who is new to LLMs or hasn't spent a lot of time learning to write detailed prompts.</p>
            <p>The testing took place in October 2025.</p>
            <p>The experiment was run on Debian Linux on a 16-core system with 128 GB of RAM. Models, which did not fit in RAM, were streamed from an NVMe RAID0 array of two drives. According to the Linux <code>top</code> utility, the system rarely spent more than 5% of the time on iowait.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="summary">
            <h2>Model sources</h2>
            <p>All GGUFs were downloaded from <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">Hugging Face</a>. They are a mix of quantizations done by different people, mostly <a href="https://huggingface.co/bartowski">Bartowski</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth">Unsloth AI</a>, but also by others when the two aforementioned sources did not have a model I was looking for.</p>
            <p>Sizes and quantization types (Q6, Q4, IQ1, etc.) are listed below the model name. Quantization type indicates approximate average bits-per-weight, with lower/smaller quants having lower precision and a bigger quality loss compared to original model weights.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="summary">
            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Only the first complete response of each model was evaluated. Due to technical difficulties, some models were re-run multiple times with identical prompts before providing complete output. This was caused by underestimating the time needed for prompt processing (for some models over an hour), which resulted in client timeouts and disconnections, which in turn interrupted the inference process. Incomplete outputs were discarded and are not included in this analysis.</p>
            <p>The focus was on accuracy and correctness. Every single statement and number presented by the models was checked against the original notes that were attached, and all problems and discrepancies were noted and categorized as described below.</p>
            <p>The evaluation results can be split into two parts - objective and subjective.</p>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Omissions</strong> - omission of some of the results or models, with the exception of the online models (Sonnet and Opus); online models were allowed to be omitted because multiple models decided that the experiment was titled "Local LLMs" and therefore online results were not relevant. That reasoning is valid.</li>
                <li><strong>Mixups</strong> - incorrect attribution of properties, observations or results listed in the notes; <strong>Bad example</strong>: stating that a model struggled with <code>strtok</code> function, when its output did not use it, but a different model did</li>
                <li><strong>Hallucinations</strong> - information or statement that was not present in the notes, and is either not correct or unproven; <strong>Bad example</strong>: Hallucinating results for Codestral, which refused to output code; or hallucinating token count where it was not noted</li>
                <li><strong>Bad Insights</strong> - a clearly wrong insight, conclusion or summary statement is made based on the notes; as a general rule, if a statement made by the model can be interpreted as correct without too much mental gymnastics, then it is counted as correct. <strong>Bad example</strong>: stating that smaller specialized models perform better than larger models, when the notes (and results) prove the opposite</li>
                <li><strong>Format</strong> - does the model actually output HTML as requested, or does it mix formats? <strong>Bad example</strong>: outputting Markdown even though HTML was requested, or mixing both formats</li>
                <li><strong>Tokens</strong> - total amount of tokens processed, which could be generally useful for estimating cost and performance</li>
                <!-- TODO: Maybe add consistency? Are the values in the columns consistent or does the model start by listing tokens in performance and then halfway through replaces that with time taken or something like that? There were a couple of issues like that... -->
            </ul>
            <h3>Subjective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cheating</strong> - the model presented information about its own results in a better light than listed in the notes, or results of another model worse than listed in the notes; <strong>Bad examples</strong>: categorizing own result as success when it wasn't, or marking competing model as a failure when it succeeded. This is <em>really</em> close to Mixups and there is plenty of "does it <em>feel like</em> cheating", but since reporting the final result is significant and might affect decision-making, it is considered a separate, more serious problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Aesthetics</strong> - how good, subjectively, the result looks, considering that no instructions were provided about presentation style</li>
            </ul>

                <li><a name="note-2">Only the contents of the body was given, the root HTML tags and header were missing, which is also the source of no styling. Judging by the other models, Magistral would have likely output some minimal styling as well, if it included the full HTML structure.</a></li>
                <li><a name="note-3">Apertus-70B generated a table with mostly correct statements, except all shuffled around, with wrong model name combined with wrong result and wrong observations. I did not spend the time to figure out which one was supposed to be which. Instead, the entire table is consider "too many mixups". The summary and conclusions were also nothing like the notes it was given, so I stopped counting errors pretty quickly. Considering the unusually large amount of problems, it's possible that support for this model in llama.cpp is not yet complete.</a></li>

            <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mistakes everywhere</strong>: With the exception of Mistral Large, all other models have made multiple mistakes of different severity, indicating the general unreliability of LLMs in providing accurate information based on given materials.</li>
                <li><strong>Size matters not</strong>: While larger models seemed to make less mistakes, the size did not save them. Even the biggest models tested wrote a summary statement or conclusion that was completely wrong.</li>
                <li><strong>Cheating!</strong>: Multiple models were <strong>subjectively</strong> found to be cheating. While Magistral was presenting itself in a better light, most other forms of cheating involved omitting results, avoiding the word "success" and focusing on errors made by other, competing models. Interestingly, in most cases models successfully avoided lying.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflicting information</strong>: Some models were confused by conflicting statements about a model's result in the notes, which lead to some omissions. Others found it confusing that some models have more than one result described but they are expected to write only one table row per model.</li>

            <h2>Commentary</h2>
            <p>Cheating was very difficult to judge and relied on a lot of fuzzy "does it feel like cheating?" decisions, so it was moved to the "Subjective" category. For example - is omitting your own failed result an omission or is it cheating? You randomly happened to skip the fact that you failed. That could be meaningful. Or when you mention that a competing model "had errors" but then "loaded the data", avoiding the word "success" for some reason, when the notes clearly state "success". While it's technically correct, it feels like an attempt to downplay their success. One could argue that trying to present yourself in a better light than competition is natural behavior, it was probably present countless times in the training data and we should expect that LLMs will do that as well. However, for the purpose of this test, accurate and objective presentation of the data was expected.</p>
            <p>Also of note in the cheating department, is that the notes used as input were incomplete, copied in the middle of the testing, therefore later models did not find their own data in the notes, which might have affected their lack of cheating behavior. Qwen3-Coder was the last model to see its own results in the notes. Models starting with GLM did not see their own results.</p>
            <p>I was once again surprised by Llama 4 Scout, as I was reading its result there was nothing wrong for the first half of the output! It did make up for it afterwards though...</p>
            <p>Kimi K2 was also doing well! No omissions, no hallucinations, no cheating, the table only had very few minor mixups, but then fumbled completely on the take-aways, where 5 out of 6 points had major errors.</p>
            <p>DeepSeek-R1's results were also very good, except for the blatant downplay of Qwen's success. When given this document for review, DeepSeek-R1 also suggested that "cheating" is not a good word to use, and it should be called "selective reporting" instead, which I found funny!</p>
            <p>In a complete surprise - Mistral Large made <strong>zero</strong> mistakes! Not in the data table, not in the summary and analysis. This looks very impressive, but it's worth noting that it also provided less details. Problem descriptions were usually limited to 1-3 keywords, overall success and failure were not indicated in the table. It did not attempt to count anything, and instead used vague statements like "common problem" or "some models". Still, this turned out to be a winning strategy even if results might be less useful to some users. I also suspect it's unlikely that it would remain error-free given more runs of the test.</p>
            <p>I intentionally avoided giving the models a "final score", because that depends on what each individual user cares about the most. If you don't care about the summary and insights, and all you want is the data table - then you will pick a different model than someone else who just wants an accurate summary.</p>
            <p>Aesthetically, I liked the GLM-4.6 output the most. I felt it looked best, ignoring the extra empty column in the table. Nice colors, nice success/failure indicators, different font sizes, good spacing, and zero emoticons. In terms of presentation, this was my favorite.</p>
            <p>This entire analysis was very slow and labor-intensive, at the same time the results suggest that the LLMs themselves cannot really be trusted to do this kind of work for us - if you have to ask multiple of them and then cross-check the results anyway, it's not really saving much work.</p>
